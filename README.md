<h1 align="center">eris-commando</h1>

---------------
`eris-commando` is a command router (framework) for the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) library. The name of the library is a play-on word that *barely* anyone uses or hates the library called `discord.js-commando`. Why did I name it `eris-commando`? Because why not.

## Installation
> Note: **Since the library is in TypeScript, it will download the `typescript` & `@types/node` dependencies. If the bot is in JS, it will not defuse the situation, it's still usable.**
>
> Master Branch:

```sh
$ npm i eris-commando
# or
$ yarn add eris-commando
```

> Indev Branch:
