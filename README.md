---------------
`eris-commando` is a command router (framework) for the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) library. The name is a play-on word of Discord.js' worst "official" framework, [discord.js-commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando) (Funny that the argument / argument collector code is reused here!). I initially started this in 2017 since I had minimum knowledge of Eris and their command framework is shit for the most part but still works; I made this repository and then deleted because I had other projects to do. On Nov 2018, this framework exploded with updates (0.2.0 -> 0.4.0) by myself, the initial starter in 2017. For Commando developers: I think the framework is awesome with it's builtin arguments but I hate the rest of it... I descrise that this is not a clone of the framework but the Argument/Types code were modified and used in this framework! (~~don't do a dmca attack :c~~)
